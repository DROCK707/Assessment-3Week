               <li>Winter is cold with lots of snow activities to enjoy</li>
               <li>Spring still has snow activities, but the valley is much more pleasant and green.</li>
               <li>Summer is hot, but nights are great. Canyons give a pleasant retreat from the heat.</li>
               <li>Fall is exciting because all the colors start to change and temperatures start to come down.</li>
