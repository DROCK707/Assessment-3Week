            id="Simba">

        <p>I graduated in 2003 from High School in California. I'm a unique Millennial because I didn't grow up with
            technology. I played video games back when it was 8-bit but they weren't that deep so I played outside and
            got dirty. When the street lights came on, that was the signal to go home.
        </p>
        <p>When technology was adolescent, I was too. I grew up with technology and adopted it was it was released.</p>
        <p>Here is a little more about me ...</p>
